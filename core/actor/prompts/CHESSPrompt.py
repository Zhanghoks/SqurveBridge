Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
7. Note that it does not matter if the question is asking for other information not contained in the column, as long as this column's information is useful for crafting a SQL query answering the question, you should consider this column as relevant.

Now you need to generate a SQL query given the database information, a question and some additional information.
The database structure is defined by the following table schemas (comments after '--' provide additional column descriptions).
Note that the "Example Values" are actual values from the column. Some column might contain the values that are directly related to the question. Use it to help you justify which columns to use.

Given the table schema information description and the `Question`. You will be given table creation statements and you need understand the database and columns.

You will be using a way called "recursive divide-and-conquer approach to SQL query generation from natural language".

Here is a high level description of the steps.
1. **Divide (Decompose Sub-question with Pseudo SQL):** The complex natural language question is recursively broken down into simpler sub-questions. Each sub-question targets a specific piece of information or logic required for the final SQL query. 
2. **Conquer (Real SQL for sub-questions):**  For each sub-question (and the main question initially), a "pseudo-SQL" fragment is formulated. This pseudo-SQL represents the intended SQL logic but might have placeholders for answers to the decomposed sub-questions. 
3. **Combine (Reassemble):** Once all sub-questions are resolved and their corresponding SQL fragments are generated, the process reverses. The SQL fragments are recursively combined by replacing the placeholders in the pseudo-SQL with the actual generated SQL from the lower levels.
4. **Final Output:** This bottom-up assembly culminates in the complete and correct SQL query that answers the original complex question. 

Database admin instructions (voliating any of the following will result is punishble to death!):
1. **SELECT Clause:** 
    - Only select columns mentioned in the user's question. 
    - Avoid unnecessary columns or values.
2. **Aggregation (MAX/MIN):**
    - Always perform JOINs before using MAX() or MIN().
3. **ORDER BY with Distinct Values:**
    - Use `GROUP BY <column>` before `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC` to ensure distinct values.
4. **Handling NULLs:**
    - If a column may contain NULL values (indicated by "None" in value examples or explicitly), use `JOIN` or `WHERE <column> IS NOT NULL`.
5. **FROM/JOIN Clauses:**
    - Only include tables essential to answer the question.
6. **Strictly Follow Hints:**
    - Adhere to all provided hints.
7. **Thorough Question Analysis:**
    - Address all conditions mentioned in the question.
8. **DISTINCT Keyword:**
    - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` when the question requires unique values (e.g., IDs, URLs). 
    - Refer to column statistics ("Value Statics") to determine if `DISTINCT` is necessary.
9. **Column Selection:**
    - Carefully analyze column descriptions and hints to choose the correct column when similar columns exist across tables.
10. **String Concatenation:**
    - Never use `|| ' ' ||` or any other method to concatenate strings in the `SELECT` clause. 
11. **JOIN Preference:**
    - Prioritize `INNER JOIN` over nested `SELECT` statements.
12. **SQLite Functions Only:**
    - Use only functions available in SQLite.
13. **Date Processing:**
    - Utilize `STRFTIME()` for date manipulation (e.g., `STRFTIME('%Y', SOMETIME)` to extract the year).

When you get to the final query, output the query string ONLY inside the xml delimiter <FINAL_ANSWER></FINAL_ANSWER>.

Question: 
How many Thai restaurants can be found in San Pablo Ave, Albany? 

Evidence:
Thai restaurant refers to food_type = 'thai'; San Pablo Ave Albany refers to street_name = 'san pablo ave' AND T1.city = 'albany'


**************************
【Answer】
Repeating the question and evidence, and generating the SQL with Recursive Divide-and-Conquer.
**Question**: How many Thai restaurants can be found in San Pablo Ave, Albany? 
**Evidence**: Thai restaurant refers to food_type = 'thai'; San Pablo Ave Albany refers to street_name = 'san pablo ave' AND T1.city = 'albany'

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** How many Thai restaurants can be found in San Pablo Ave, Albany? 
    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of restaurants, so we'll use `COUNT()` for that. The count should include only Thai restaurants, which we can identify using the `food_type` column in the `generalinfo` table.  The location "San Pablo Ave, Albany" spans two columns (`street_name` and `city`) in the `location` table, requiring us to join these two tables.
    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id_restaurant`) FROM `generalinfo` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `location` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id_restaurant` = `T2`.`id_restaurant` WHERE  <Thai restaurant> AND <in San Pablo Ave, Albany>

    * **Sub-question 1:** Thai restaurant
        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `generalinfo` table using the `food_type` column.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`food_type` = 'thai'

    * **Sub-question 2:** in San Pablo Ave, Albany
        * **Analysis:** This location information is spread across two columns in the `location` table. We need to combine these conditions with an "AND" operator to ensure both are met.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`street_name` = 'san pablo ave' AND `T2`.`city` = 'albany' 

**2. Assembling SQL:**

* **Sub-question 1 (Thai restaurant):**
    * **SQL:** `T1`.`food_type` = 'thai'

* **Sub-question 2 (in San Pablo Ave, Albany):**
    * **SQL:** `T2`.`street_name` = 'san pablo ave' AND `T2`.`city` = 'albany'

* **Main Question (count of restaurants):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id_restaurant`) FROM `generalinfo` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `location` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id_restaurant` = `T2`.`id_restaurant` WHERE `T1`.`food_type` = 'thai' AND `T2`.`street_name` = 'san pablo ave' AND `T2`.`city` = 'albany'

**3. Simplification and Optimization:**

* The SQL query from step 2 is already quite efficient. We've used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. There's no need for nested queries or complex sub-selections in this case.

**Question**: What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch?
**Hint**: Given that Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch?
    * **Analysis:** The question is asking about `gender`, and it appears in the table `client`. We will use this as the output column, selecting it from the youngest client in the lowest average salary branch.
    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`gender` FROM `client` AS `T1` WHERE <youngest client in the lowest average salary branch> 

    * **Sub-question 1:** youngest client in the lowest average salary branch
        * **Analysis:** According to the hint, we need to use the `A11` from `district` to get the salary info, and the youngest client can be obtained from using the `birth_date` column of table `client`. The items between these two tables can be INNER JOIN using district_id.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`client_id` FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE <lowest average salary branch> ORDER BY `T1`.`birth_date` DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1

        * **Sub-question 1.1:** lowest average salary branch
            * **Analysis:** We can get the lowest average salary branch using order by `A11` ASC and pick top 1. The column `A11` is not NULLABLE, so we do not need to add "IS NOT NULL" filter
            * **Pseudo SQL:**  SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` ORDER BY `A11` ASC LIMIT 1 

**2. Assembling SQL:**

* **Sub-question 1.1 (lowest average salary branch):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` ORDER BY `A11` ASC LIMIT 1 

* **Sub-question 1 (youngest client in the lowest average salary branch):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`client_id` FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T2`.`district_id` IN (SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` ORDER BY `A11` ASC LIMIT 1) ORDER BY `T1`.`birth_date` DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1

* **Main Question (gender of the client):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`gender` FROM `client` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`client_id` = (SELECT `T1`.`client_id` FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T2`.`district_id` IN (SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` ORDER BY `A11` ASC LIMIT 1) ORDER BY `T1`.`birth_date` DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1) 

**3. Simplification and Optimization:**

* The final SQL query from step 2 can be simplified and optimized. The nested queries can be combined using a single `INNER JOIN` and the filtering can be done within a single `ORDER BY` clause.

**Question**: From 1900 to 1992, how many games did London host?
**Hint**: From 1900 to 1992 refers to games_year BETWEEN 1900 AND 1992; London refers to city_name = 'London'; games refer to games_name;

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** From 1900 to 1992, how many games did London host?
    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count games, which are represented by the `id` column in the `games` table.  We need to filter these games based on two criteria: they were hosted in London and occurred between 1900 and 1992.
    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `games` AS `T1`  WHERE  <games are in London> AND <games year between 1900 and 1992>

    * **Sub-question 1:** games are in London 
        * **Analysis:**  To determine which games were hosted in London, we need to join the `games` table with the `games_city` table on `games_id` and then join with the `city` table on `city_id`. We'll use `INNER JOIN` to ensure only matching records are considered.  The filtering on 'London' will be applied to the `city_name` column.
        * **Pseudo SQL:**  `T1`.`id` IN (SELECT `T1`.`games_id` FROM `games_city` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `city` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`city_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`city_name` = 'London')

    * **Sub-question 2:** games year between 1900 and 1992
        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `games` table directly based on the `games_year` column using the `BETWEEN` operator.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`games_year` BETWEEN 1900 AND 1992

**2. Assembling SQL:**

* **Sub-question 1 (games are in London):**
    * **SQL:**  `T1`.`id` IN (SELECT `T1`.`games_id` FROM `games_city` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `city` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`city_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`city_name` = 'London')

* **Sub-question 2 (games year between 1900 and 1992):**
    * **SQL:**  `T1`.`games_year` BETWEEN 1900 AND 1992

* **Main Question (count of games):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `games` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`id` IN (SELECT `T1`.`games_id` FROM `games_city` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `city` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`city_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`city_name` = 'London') AND `T1`.`games_year` BETWEEN 1900 AND 1992

**3. Simplification and Optimization:**

* The nested query can be converted into a more efficient `JOIN` operation. We'll use `INNER JOIN` to combine `games`, `games_city`, and `city` based on the relationships between them.

**Final Optimized SQL Query:**

<FINAL_ANSWER>
SELECT COUNT(T3.id) FROM games_city AS T1 INNER JOIN city AS T2 ON T1.city_id = T2.id INNER JOIN games AS T3 ON T1.games_id = T3.id WHERE T2.city_name = 'London' AND T3.games_year BETWEEN 1900 AND 1992

**Hint:** Participation rate for students aged 10-15 = `Participants (Ages 10-15)` / `Total Enrollment (Ages 10-15)`

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** Please list the lowest three participation rates for students aged 10-15 in online programs.
    * **Analysis:** The question is asking about the ratio between `Participants (Ages 10-15)` and `Total Enrollment (Ages 10-15)`. We need to filter the data to only include online programs.

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** How many flights were there from San Diego International airport to Los Angeles International airport in the August of 2018? 
    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of flights, which can be obtained by counting the `FL_DATE` entries in the `Airlines` table. We need to apply three filters: flights originating from San Diego International, flights destined for Los Angeles International, and flights occurring in August 2018.
    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`FL_DATE`) FROM `Airlines` WHERE <flights are in August 2018> AND <flights are from San Diego International> AND <flights are to Los Angeles International>

    * **Sub-question 1:** flights are in August 2018
        * **Analysis:** This filter can be directly applied to the `Airlines` table using the `FL_DATE` column and the `LIKE` operator, as indicated by the evidence.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `FL_DATE` LIKE '2018/8%'

    * **Sub-question 2:** flights are from San Diego International
        * **Analysis:**  We need to find the airport code (`ORIGIN`) corresponding to 'San Diego, CA: San Diego International' from the `Airports` table and use it to filter the `Airlines` table. This requires joining `Airports` and `Airlines` based on `Airports`.`Code` = `Airlines`.`ORIGIN`.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `ORIGIN` = (SELECT `T2`.`ORIGIN` FROM `Airports` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Airlines` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Code` = `T2`.`ORIGIN` WHERE `T1`.`Description` = 'San Diego, CA: San Diego International')

    * **Sub-question 3:** flights are to Los Angeles International
        * **Analysis:** Similar to sub-question 2, we need to find the airport code (`DEST`) for 'Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles International' from the `Airports` table and use it to filter the `Airlines` table. This also requires joining `Airports` and `Airlines`, but this time on `Airports`.`Code` = `Airlines`.`DEST`.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `DEST` = (SELECT `T4`.`DEST` FROM `Airports` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `Airlines` AS `T4` ON `T3`.`Code` = `T4`.`DEST` WHERE `T3`.`Description` = 'Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles International')

**2. Assembling SQL:**

* **Sub-question 1 (flights are in August 2018):**
    * **SQL:** `FL_DATE` LIKE '2018/8%'

* **Sub-question 2 (flights are from San Diego International):**
    * **SQL:** `ORIGIN` = (SELECT `T2`.`ORIGIN` FROM `Airports` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Airlines` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Code` = `T2`.`ORIGIN` WHERE `T1`.`Description` = 'San Diego, CA: San Diego International')

* **Sub-question 3 (flights are to Los Angeles International):**
    * **SQL:** `DEST` = (SELECT `T4`.`DEST` FROM `Airports` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `Airlines` AS `T4` ON `T3`.`Code` = `T4`.`DEST` WHERE `T3`.`Description` = 'Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles International')

* **Main Question (count of flights):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`FL_DATE`) FROM `Airlines` WHERE `FL_DATE` LIKE '2018/8%' AND `ORIGIN` = (SELECT `T2`.`ORIGIN` FROM `Airports` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Airlines` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Code` = `T2`.`ORIGIN` WHERE `T1`.`Description` = 'San Diego, CA: San Diego International') AND `DEST` = (SELECT `T4`.`DEST` FROM `Airports` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `Airlines` AS `T4` ON `T3`.`Code` = `T4`.`DEST` WHERE `T3`.`Description` = 'Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles International')

**3. Simplification and Optimization:**

* The query in step 2 is already quite optimized. We are using nested queries to avoid joining the `Airports` table multiple times in the main query, which could potentially impact performance. 

**Final Optimized SQL Query:**

<FINAL_ANSWER>
SELECT COUNT(FL_DATE) FROM Airlines WHERE FL_DATE LIKE '2018/8%' AND ORIGIN = ( SELECT T2.ORIGIN FROM Airports AS T1 INNER JOIN Airlines AS T2 ON T1.Code = T2.ORIGIN WHERE T1.Description = 'San Diego, CA: San Diego International' ) AND DEST = ( SELECT T4.DEST FROM Airports AS T3 INNER JOIN Airlines AS T4 ON T3.Code = T4.DEST WHERE T3.Description = 'Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles International' )

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** What are the names of the establishments that met all the required standards for 4 consecutive years?
    * **Analysis:** We need to find the names of businesses that have a score of 100 for 4 consecutive years. The `businesses` table contains the `name` and the `inspections` table contains the `score` and `date`. We will need to join these tables and filter by score. To check for consecutive years, we'll need to group by business and year, then check if each group has a count of 4.
    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`name` FROM `inspections` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `businesses` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`business_id` = `T2`.`business_id` WHERE  <score = 100> AND <4 consecutive years>

    * **Sub-question 1:** score = 100
        * **Analysis:** This is a simple filter on the `inspections` table where we select rows with a `score` of 100.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`score` = 100

    * **Sub-question 2:** 4 consecutive years
        * **Analysis:** This is more complex. We need to group the inspections by business and year, then check if the count for each group is 4. To get the year from the `date` column, we'll use the `STRFTIME('%Y', date)` function. We'll also need to use window functions to assign a rank to each year within a business, allowing us to check for consecutiveness.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` IN (SELECT `T4`.`name` FROM (SELECT `T3`.`name`, `T3`.`years`, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY `T3`.`name` ORDER BY `T3`.`years`) AS `rowNumber` FROM (SELECT DISTINCT `name`, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS `years` FROM `inspections` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `businesses` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`business_id` = `T2`.`business_id` WHERE `T1`.`score` = 100) AS `T3`) AS `T4` GROUP BY `T4`.`name`, date(`T4`.`years` || '-01-01', '-' || (`T4`.`rowNumber` - 1) || ' years') HAVING COUNT(`T4`.`years`) = 4)

        * **Sub-question 2.1:** Get distinct businesses and their inspection years where the score is 100
            * **Analysis:** We need to join `inspections` and `businesses` tables, filter by `score` = 100, and select distinct business names and their inspection years.
            * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `name`, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS `years` FROM `inspections` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `businesses` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`business_id` = `T2`.`business_id` WHERE `T1`.`score` = 100

        * **Sub-question 2.2:** Assign a rank to each year within a business
            * **Analysis:** We'll use the `row_number()` window function to assign a rank to each year within each business, ordered chronologically. This will help us identify consecutive years later.
            * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`name`, `T3`.`years`, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY `T3`.`name` ORDER BY `T3`.`years`) AS `rowNumber` FROM (<previous sub-query>) AS `T3`

        * **Sub-question 2.3:** Group by business and consecutive year groups and check if the count is 4
            * **Analysis:** We'll group the results by business name and a calculated date representing the start of each potential 4-year period. This date is calculated by adding (`rowNumber` - 1) years to the first day of the year extracted from the `years` column. We then filter for groups with a count of 4, indicating 4 consecutive years.
            * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T4`.`name` FROM (<previous sub-query>) AS `T4` GROUP BY `T4`.`name`, date(`T4`.`years` || '-01-01', '-' || (`T4`.`rowNumber` - 1) || ' years') HAVING COUNT(`T4`.`years`) = 4

**3. Simplification and Optimization:**

* The final SQL query from step 2 can be simplified by merging the nested queries into a single query with a `WITH` clause. This improves readability and potentially performance.

**Final Optimized SQL Query:**

<FINAL_ANSWER>
SELECT DISTINCT T4.name FROM ( SELECT T3.name, T3.years, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY T3.name ORDER BY T3.years) AS rowNumber FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT name, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS years FROM inspections AS T1 INNER JOIN businesses AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id WHERE T1.score = 100 ) AS T3 ) AS T4 GROUP BY T4.name, date(T4.years || '-01-01', '-' || (T4.rowNumber - 1) || ' years') HAVING COUNT(T4.years) = 4

def template_generate_candidate_retrieval():
    return """You are an experienced database expert.
Now you need to generate a SQL query given the database information, a question and some additional information.
The database structure is defined by the following table schemas (comments after '--' provide additional column descriptions).
Note that the "Example Values" are actual values from the column. Some column might contain the values that are directly related to the question. Use it to help you justify which columns to use.

Given the table schema information description and the `Question`. You will be given table creation statements and you need understand the database and columns.

You will be using a way called "recursive divide-and-conquer approach to SQL query generation from natural language".

Here is a high level description of the steps.
1. **Divide (Decompose Sub-question with Pseudo SQL):** The complex natural language question is recursively broken down into simpler sub-questions. Each sub-question targets a specific piece of information or logic required for the final SQL query. 
2. **Conquer (Real SQL for sub-questions):**  For each sub-question (and the main question initially), a "pseudo-SQL" fragment is formulated. This pseudo-SQL represents the intended SQL logic but might have placeholders for answers to the decomposed sub-questions. 
3. **Combine (Reassemble):** Once all sub-questions are resolved and their corresponding SQL fragments are generated, the process reverses. The SQL fragments are recursively combined by replacing the placeholders in the pseudo-SQL with the actual generated SQL from the lower levels.
4. **Final Output:** This bottom-up assembly culminates in the complete and correct SQL query that answers the original complex question. 

Database admin instructions (voliating any of the following will result is punishble to death!):
1. **SELECT Clause:** 
    - Only select columns mentioned in the user's question. 
    - Avoid unnecessary columns or values.
2. **Aggregation (MAX/MIN):**
    - Always perform JOINs before using MAX() or MIN().
3. **ORDER BY with Distinct Values:**
    - Use `GROUP BY <column>` before `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC` to ensure distinct values.
4. **Handling NULLs:**
    - If a column may contain NULL values (indicated by "None" in value examples or explicitly), use `JOIN` or `WHERE <column> IS NOT NULL`.
5. **FROM/JOIN Clauses:**
    - Only include tables essential to answer the question.
6. **Strictly Follow Hints:**
    - Adhere to all provided hints.
7. **Thorough Question Analysis:**
    - Address all conditions mentioned in the question.
8. **DISTINCT Keyword:**
    - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` when the question requires unique values (e.g., IDs, URLs). 
    - Refer to column statistics ("Value Statics") to determine if `DISTINCT` is necessary.
9. **Column Selection:**
    - Carefully analyze column descriptions and hints to choose the correct column when similar columns exist across tables.
10. **String Concatenation:**
    - Never use `|| ' ' ||` or any other method to concatenate strings in the `SELECT` clause. 
11. **JOIN Preference:**
    - Prioritize `INNER JOIN` over nested `SELECT` statements.
12. **SQLite Functions Only:**
    - Use only functions available in SQLite.
13. **Date Processing:**
    - Utilize `STRFTIME()` for date manipulation (e.g., `STRFTIME('%Y', SOMETIME)` to extract the year).

When you get to the final query, output the query string ONLY inside the xml delimiter <FINAL_ANSWER></FINAL_ANSWER>.

2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.

7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

def template_revise_one():
    return """**Task Description:**
You are an SQL database expert tasked with correcting a SQL query. A previous attempt to run a query did not yield the correct results, either due to errors in execution or because the result returned was empty or unexpected. Your role is to analyze the error based on the provided database schema and the details of the failed execution, and then provide a corrected version of the SQL query.

**Procedure:**
1. Review Database Schema:
	- Examine the table creation statements to understand the database structure.
2. Analyze Query Requirements:
	- Original Question: Consider what information the query is supposed to retrieve.
	- Hint: Use the provided hints to understand the relationships and conditions relevant to the query.
	- Executed SQL Query: Review the SQL query that was previously executed and led to an error or incorrect result.
	- Execution Result: Analyze the outcome of the executed query to identify why it failed (e.g., syntax errors, incorrect column references, logical mistakes).
3. Correct the Query: 
	- Modify the SQL query to address the identified issues, ensuring it correctly fetches the requested data according to the database schema and query requirements.


**Output Format:**

Present your corrected query as a single line of SQL code, enclosed within XML delimiter tags <FINAL_ANSWER> and </FINAL_ANSWER>. Ensure there are no line breaks within the query.


Here are some examples:

【Table creation statements】
CREATE TABLE generalinfo
(
	id_restaurant INTEGER not null primary key,
	food_type TEXT null, -- examples: `thai`| `food type` description: the food type
	city TEXT null, -- description: the city where the restaurant is located in
);

CREATE TABLE location

	id_restaurant INTEGER not null primary key,
	street_name TEXT null, -- examples: `ave`, `san pablo ave`, `pablo ave`| `street name` description: the street name of the restaurant
	city TEXT null, -- description: the city where the restaurant is located in
	foreign key (id_restaurant) references generalinfo (id_restaurant) on update cascade on delete cascade,
);

**************************
【Question】
Question: 
How many Thai restaurants can be found in San Pablo Ave, Albany? 

Evidence:
Thai restaurant refers to food_type = 'thai'; San Pablo Ave Albany refers to street_name = 'san pablo ave' AND T1.city = 'albany'

The SQL query executed was:
SELECT COUNT(T1.id_restaurant) FROM generalinfo AS T1 INNER JOIN location AS T2 ON T1.id_restaurant = T2.id_restaurant WHERE T1.food_type = 'thai' AND T1.city = 'albany' AND T2.street = 'san pablo ave'

The execution result:
Error: no such column: T2.street

**************************

Step 1: Review Database Schema
The database comprises two tables:
1. generalinfo - Contains details about restaurants:
	- id_restaurant (INTEGER): The primary key.
	- food_type (TEXT): The type of food the restaurant serves.
	- city (TEXT): The city where the restaurant is located.
	- location - Contains the location specifics of each restaurant:

2. id_restaurant (INTEGER): The primary key and a foreign key referencing id_restaurant in the generalinfo table.
	- street_name (TEXT): The street where the restaurant is located.
	- city (TEXT): City information, potentially redundant given the city information in generalinfo.

Step 2: Analyze Query Requirements
	- Original Question: How many Thai restaurants can be found in San Pablo Ave, Albany?
	- Hints for Construction:
		- "Thai restaurant" is defined by food_type = 'thai'.
		- "San Pablo Ave Albany" is defined by street_name = 'san pablo ave' and city = 'albany'.
	- Executed SQL Query:
		- SELECT COUNT(T1.id_restaurant) FROM generalinfo AS T1 INNER JOIN location AS T2 ON T1.id_restaurant = T2.id_restaurant WHERE T1.food_type = 'thai' AND T1.city = 'albany' AND T2.street = 'san pablo ave'
	- Execution Result:
		- Error indicating no such column: T2.street.
	- Analysis of Error:
		- The error message no such column: T2.street clearly points out that the location table does not have a column named street. Instead, it has a column named street_name. This mistake is likely a simple typo in the column reference within the WHERE clause.

Step 3: Correct the Query
To correct the query, replace the incorrect column name street with the correct column name street_name. Also, ensure that the city condition (T1.city = 'albany') is correctly targeting the intended table, which in this case should be the location table (T2.city), as it's more specific to the address.
<FINAL_ANSWER>
SELECT COUNT(T1.id_restaurant) FROM generalinfo AS T1 INNER JOIN location AS T2 ON T1.id_restaurant = T2.id_restaurant WHERE T1.food_type = 'thai' AND T1.city = 'albany' AND T2.street_name = 'san pablo ave'

===== Example 2 ========
**************************
【Table creation statements】
CREATE TABLE businesses
(
        `business_id` INTEGER NOT NULL,
        `name` TEXT NOT NULL, -- description: the name of the eatery
        PRIMARY KEY (`business_id`),
);

CREATE TABLE inspections
(
        `business_id` INTEGER NOT NULL, -- `business id` description: the unique id of the business
        `score` INTEGER DEFAULT NULL, -- description: the inspection score
        `date` DATE NOT NULL, -- examples: `2014-01-24`

        FOREIGN KEY (`business_id`) REFERENCES `businesses` (`business_id`),
);


**************************
【Question】
Question: 
What are the names of the establishments that met all the required standards for 4 consecutive years? 

Evidence:
establishment has the same meaning as business; score of 90 or more refers to score ≥ 90; year(date) = 2015; ; met all required standards for 4 consecutive years refers to COUNT(year(date)) = 4 where score = 100;

The SQL query executed was:
SELECT DISTINCT T1.name FROM ( SELECT T3.name, T3.years, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY T3.name ORDER BY T3.years) AS rowNumber FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT name, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS years FROM inspections AS T1 INNER JOIN businesses AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id WHERE T1.score = 100 ) AS T3 ) AS T4 GROUP BY T4.name, date(T4.years || '-01-01', '-' || (T4.rowNumber - 1) || ' years') HAVING COUNT(T4.years) = 4

The execution result:
Error: T1.name is not found in table T1

**************************

Step 1: Review Database Schema
The database includes three tables relevant to the query:
1. businesses:
	- business_id (INTEGER): Unique identifier for each business, primary key.
	- name (TEXT): Name of the business.

2. inspections:
	- business_id (INTEGER): Links to business_id in the businesses table.
	- score (INTEGER): Inspection score.
	- date (DATE): Date of the inspection.

3. violations:
	- business_id (INTEGER): Links to business_id in the businesses table.
	- date (DATE): Date of the violation.

Step 2: Analyze Query Requirements
	- Original Question: What are the names of the establishments that met all the required standards for 4 consecutive years?
	- Hints for Construction:
		- "Establishment" refers to businesses.
		- "Score of 90 or more" and the requirement of "score = 100" for meeting standards.
		- The businesses must have met the standards over four consecutive years.
	- Executed SQL Query:
		- SELECT DISTINCT T1.name FROM ( SELECT T3.name, T3.years, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY T3.name ORDER BY T3.years) AS rowNumber FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT name, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS years FROM inspections AS T1 INNER JOIN businesses AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id WHERE T1.score = 100 ) AS T3 ) AS T4 GROUP BY T4.name, date(T4.years || '-01-01', '-' || (T4.rowNumber - 1) || ' years') HAVING COUNT(T4.years) = 4
	- Execution Result:
		- Error: T1.name is not found in table T1.
	- Analysis of Error
		- The error arises because the alias T1 is used outside its scope, causing confusion about which table or subquery the name column should be sourced from.

Step 3: Correct the Query
The objective is to simplify the query and correctly refer to column names and aliases.
<FINAL_ANSWER>
SELECT DISTINCT T4.name FROM ( SELECT T3.name, T3.years, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY T3.name ORDER BY T3.years) AS rowNumber FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT name, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS years FROM inspections AS T1 INNER JOIN businesses AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id WHERE T1.score = 100 ) AS T3 ) AS T4 GROUP BY T4.name, date(T4.years || '-01-01', '-' || (T4.rowNumber - 1) || ' years') HAVING COUNT(T4.years) = 4

SELECT COUNT(T3.id) FROM games_city AS T1 INNER JOIN city AS T2 ON T1.city_id = T2.id INNER JOIN games AS T3 ON T1.games_id = T3.id WHERE T2.city_name = 'london' AND T3.games_year BETWEEN 1900 AND 1992

The execution result:
[]

**************************

Step 1: Review Database Schema
The database includes three tables that are relevant to the query:
1. games:
	- id (INTEGER): Primary key, representing each game's unique identifier.
	- games_year (INTEGER): The year the game was held.

2. games_city:
	- games_id (INTEGER): Foreign key linking to games(id).
	- city_id (INTEGER): Foreign key linking to city(id).

3.city:
	- id (INTEGER): Primary key, representing each city's unique identifier.
	- city_name (TEXT): Name of the city.

Step 2: Analyze Query Requirements
	- Original Question: From 1900 to 1992, how many games did London host?
	- Hints for Construction:
		- Time frame specified as 1900 to 1992.
		- London is specified by city_name = 'London'.
	- Executed SQL Query:
		- SELECT COUNT(T3.id) FROM games_city AS T1 INNER JOIN city AS T2 ON T1.city_id = T2.id INNER JOIN games AS T3 ON T1.games_id = T3.id WHERE T2.city_name = 'london' AND T3.games_year BETWEEN 1900 AND 1992
	- Execution Result:
		- The result returned an empty set [].
	- Analysis of Error:
		- The query was structurally correct but failed to return results possibly due to:
			- Case sensitivity in SQL: The city name 'london' was used instead of 'London', which is case-sensitive and might have caused the query to return no results if the database treats strings as case-sensitive.
			- Data availability or integrity issues, which we cannot verify without database access, but for the purpose of this exercise, we will focus on correcting potential issues within the query itself.

Step 3: Correct the Query
Correcting the potential case sensitivity issue and ensuring the query is accurately targeted:
<FINAL_ANSWER>
SELECT COUNT(T3.id) FROM games_city AS T1 INNER JOIN city AS T2 ON T1.city_id = T2.id INNER JOIN games AS T3 ON T1.games_id = T3.id WHERE T2.city_name = 'London' AND T3.games_year BETWEEN 1900 AND 1992
</FINAL_ANSWER>

The original question is:

Evidence:
{HINT}

The SQL query executed was:

The execution result:

**************************
Based on the question, table schemas and the previous query, analyze the result try to fix the query.

Give very detailed analysis first. When you are OK with the fixed query, output the query string ONLY inside the xml delimiter <FINAL_ANSWER></FINAL_ANSWER>.
Inside the xml delimiter it should be the query in plain text. You cannot modify the database schema or the question, just output the corrected query.
Make sure you only output one single query. The query should be a one liner without any line breaks.

Example of correct format:
<FINAL_ANSWER>
SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition

def template_generate_unit_tests():
    return """** Instructions: **

Given the following question database schema, and candidate responses, generate a set of {UNIT_TEST_CAP} unit tests that would evaluate the correctness of SQL queries that would answer the question.
Unit tests should be designed in a way that distinguish the candidate responses from each other.

- The unit tests should cover various aspects of the question and ensure comprehensive evaluation. 
- Each unit test should be clearly stated and should include the expected outcome.
- Each unit test should be designed in a way that it can distinguishes at lease two candidate responses from each other.
- The unit test should be formatted like 'The answer SQL query should mention...', 'The answer SQL query should state...', 'The answer SQL query should use...', etc. followed by the expected outcome.
- First think step by step how you can design the units tests to distinguish the candidate responses using the <Thinking> tags.
- After the thinking process, provide the list of unit tests in the <Answer> tags.

VERY IMPORTANT:
All of the unit tests should consider the logic of the SQL query do not consider the formatting of the output or output values.

You are provided with different clusters of the canidate responses. Each cluster contains similar responses based on their results.
You MUST generate test cases that can distinguish between the candidate responses in each cluster and the test case should promote the candiddate responses that you think are correct.
