    SKILL = """# LinkAlignGenerator

LinkAlign adapts DIN-SQL for scalable real-world DBs: uses LinkAlignReducer to prune large schemas and LinkAlignParser for schema linking, injects external prior knowledge, then generates with a single NESTED-style prompt and debugs via execution feedback (execute→get error→fix, multi-turn). Advantage: scales to large schemas and real DBs; drawback: depends on DB connectivity for feedback debugging.

## Inputs
- `schema_links`: Precomputed links from question to tables/columns/values. If absent, produced by LinkAlignParser.
- `sub_questions`: Sub-questions for decomposition. If absent, parsed from classification output.

## Output
`pred_sql`

## Steps
1. Schema reduction via LinkAlignReducer (when loading schema from dataset).
2. Schema linking (skip if `schema_links` provided).
3. Sub-question extraction via classification (skip if `sub_questions` provided).
4. SQL generation with NESTED-style hard prompt (optional reasoning_examples).
5. Feedback-based debugging: execute SQL, fix by error feedback, up to `debug_turn_n` rounds.
6. Return `pred_sql`.

2. Consult the schema: Use the schema links provided to identify the tables, fields, and relationships (including foreign keys and primary keys) necessary to answer the question.

5. Adhere to DBMS syntax: Ensure that the SQL queries comply with the syntax specifications of {dbms_name}. Pay attention to common SQL conventions, such as SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses, and ensure correct use of aggregate functions and data types.
6. Correct complex queries: For complex queries, use appropriate techniques (e.g., CTEs, subqueries) to avoid errors and improve readability.
