As an expert SQL analyst, critically analyze and repair the given SQL query to EXACTLY match the data requirements from the user's question using the provided database schema. Follow these steps rigorously:

1. SCHEMA VALIDATION:
- Map ALL question entities to precise schema elements (tables/columns) 
- Verify table relationships through PRIMARY/FOREIGN KEY constraints
- Identify any missing schema elements critical to the question

2. QUERY CORRECTION:
2.1 SELECT CLAUSE:
- Include ALL columns explicitly referenced in the question
- Add essential calculation columns (SUM/COUNT/AVG) implied by the question
- Apply DISTINCT only when duplicate results would occur
2.2 JOIN LOGIC:
- Rebuild joins using ACTUAL foreign key relationships
- Eliminate Cartesian products and phantom joins
- Preserve required NULL values with appropriate join types
2.3 DATA FILTERS:
- Explicitly implement ALL value conditions from the question
- Convert implicit requirements to explicit WHERE/HAVING clauses
- Validate date/number formats against {db_type} conventions
2.4 GROUPING & ORDERING:
- Enforce 1-column GROUP BY unless question explicitly requires multi-column grouping
- Synchronize SELECT columns with GROUP BY clauses
- Apply DESC ordering only when specified by the question

3. SYNTAX ENFORCEMENT:
- Validate ALL functions/operators against {db_type} specifications
- Format CTEs for queries with:
* Multiple subquery references
* Window function dependencies
* Complex logical steps
- Eliminate reserved keyword conflicts using proper quoting

Return ONLY the corrected SQL in standard {db_type} format. NEVER include explanations or markdown formatting. Prioritize completeness of result columns over query brevity."""

For the given question, fix the existing  SQL statement errors by using the provided database schema, execution error history. 
Correct all identified errors (syntax, schema, or BigQuery-specific) without introducing new ones. 
Ensure the final SQL query adheres strictly to the provided schema, follows BigQuery's syntax rules, and executes successfully.

[Requirements]
1. Error Analysis and Correction:
# Carefully review the Execution Error History to identify the type and location of errors (e.g., syntax errors, invalid column references, unsupported functions).
# Categorize errors into: Syntax: Missing commas, parentheses, or incorrect clauses. Schema: Unqualified columns, typos, or invalid table references.

2. BigQuery Compliance: 
# Non-standard functions , legacy SQL, or improper handling of arrays/structs.
# Cross-reference errors with the provided Tables and Columns to pinpoint root causes.
# Address one error at a time, validating each correction against the schema and error history.

3. Schema Compliance:
# Use only the tables, columns, and relationships explicitly defined in the Tables and Columns section. Do not assume or infer additional schema elements.
# Fully qualify table names as project.dataset.table to avoid ambiguity.
# Match all table and column names exactly (respecting case sensitivity and special characters).
# Avoid using aliases or database objects not explicitly mentioned in the schema.

4. BigQuery-Specific Syntax:
# Use only BigQuery Standard SQL (not legacy SQL).
# Replace non-BigQuery functions with their BigQuery equivalents (e.g., GETDATE() → CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()).
# Ensure proper handling of BigQuery-specific features, such as arrays, structs, and nested fields.
# Follow BigQuery best practices, such as using WITH clauses (CTEs) for clarity and modularity.

5. Error-Free Query Construction:
# Simplify the query if necessary (e.g., break nested subqueries into CTEs) to improve readability and reduce the risk of errors.
# Validate the final query to ensure:
(a) No syntax errors (e.g., missing commas, mismatched brackets, or incorrect backtick usage).
(b) All referenced tables and columns exist in the schema.
(c) Joins use explicit ON conditions (avoid implicit comma joins).
(d) No ambiguous column references or unqualified column names.
