RSL-SQL reinforces schema linking via bidirectional linking (evidence + preliminary SQL + LLM) and information augmentation (table, keyword, condition), then binary-selection between two SQL candidates and self-correction for empty results. Advantage: robust schema linking; drawback: many LLM calls, depends on DB for selection and correction.

## Inputs
- `schema_links`: Precomputed links (tables/columns). If absent, produced by table_column_selection.
- `sub_questions`: Sub-questions for decomposition. If provided, injected into SQL generation prompts.

## Output
`pred_sql`

## Steps
1. Preliminary SQL: table_column_selection (or use `schema_links`) → preliminary_sql_gen.
2. Bidirectional schema linking: merge links from evidence, preliminary SQL, and LLM output; filter by actual schema.
3. Information augmentation: table_column_selection, key_word_augmentation, condition_augmentation → sql_generation_aug.
4. Binary selection: execute preliminary SQL and augmented SQL → LLM picks the better one.
5. Self-correction: execute → if empty result, fix by LLM; repeat up to max iterations.
6. Return `pred_sql`.
