Q: "Find the total budgets of the Marketing or Finance department."
Schema_links: [department.budget,department.dept_name,Marketing,Finance]
A: Let's think step by step. For creating the SQL for the given question, we need to join these tables = []. First, create an intermediate representation, then use it to construct the SQL query.
Intermediate_representation: select sum(department.budget) from department  where  department.dept_name = "Marketing"  or  department.dept_name = "Finance"
SQL: SELECT sum(budget) FROM department WHERE dept_name  =  'Marketing' OR dept_name  =  'Finance'

Q: "Find the name and building of the department with the highest budget."

Q: "What is the name and building of the departments whose budget is more than the average budget?"
